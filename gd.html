                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">This project Was a continuation of our Photoshop skills and needed some illustrator too. I wanted to incorporate my logo, 
                            so I thought of making a phone advertisement. I started off by designing the phone in illustrator with different colors. Next, I put it into Photoshop, added some 
                            text, the background, and then I was done. I think it would have been better if I made the billboard background transparent, but I needed at least one photo that I took.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">This Project was mainly to learn about basic illustrator tools
                            and color schemes. We started off with a sketch in our drawing book of 4 animals we want to draw, but we
                            have to draw them with basic shapes only. Next, we drew the full drawing in our book. After that, we started making
                            it in illustrator without color. Finally, we added colors to the project and polished it.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">This project was mainly to learn and get used to the pen tool. We started off
                            by taking a picture and outlining our face, body, and hair. Next, we colored as we went and continued outlining the different
                            facial features. Finally, we added some shades.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">This project was to test our Photoshop skills and be creative. We selected our favorite app and created a box for it as if apps came in
                            boxes. The app I chose was brawl stars. I choose to be a little creative and made the concept of a figurine that you can scan into the app and unlock characters and abilities. 
                            I went with the default character, Nita, because she is very iconic for the game and has many different skins to choose from.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">This project is a planner cover for the school planner next year. The best planner voted
                            on is selected for next year's actual planner cover. I started by looking at the similarities between the planners over the years
                            and selected a few elements I wanted to be in my planner. Those included a palm tree, a sky/galaxy, and minimalism. I started with four
                            sketches in my drawing book and recreated all 3 in illustrator. Finally, I showed them to some of my friends and selected the one with the
                            most votes to continue working on. In the end, I am happy with the result of the cover.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">This Was our Quarter one Fianl project to test our overall skills. We needed to create a horror movie
                            poster that relates to a career that we want to pursue. Since I have never watched any horror movies, I thought of making one about my favorite
                            game, Minecraft. There is a rumor in Minecraft about a former Mojang employe know as Entity 303, that was fired for a unknown reason. He wants to 
                            get revenge on Noth by hacking players worlds, so I though of making a horror movie about Entity 303 hacking steve, the default name and skin in minecraft.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">This project was a refresher and the first project in GD 3-4. I went with a scene of Among Us V.S A robot I created based off of a youtuber. 
                            This design was based off of a anime air bender I saw as an example with gave the idea of minimal graphics and a intense fight scene.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">This assignment was about making a button pin based off of a common theme. I had to include Westview so I chose to put the logo in the screen 
                            of the mac. I chose to manufacture the Mac in the end because of it's vibrant colors and having the Westview logo will make others take one because it relates to thew school.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">I started off by thinking of doing a amoled design which is the idea of a minimal (mostly black) photo to save energy on your phone. I also 
                            chose to go with a space/astronaut theme. I also decided to put quotes to match each design.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">This assignment was resurrected after almost 5 years from the last time we did it. This assignment was that we had to create a gig poster 
                            for our favorite artists and I chose Qumu which creates music remixes from video games. I went with coconut mall for the memes and decided to make the location isle Delfino so it 
                            can match with the idea.</p>

                        <h1 style="height: 5px; padding-left: 10px;">Munny</h1>
                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">This project I am most proud of and was lots of fun. The idea was to design a Munny. I chose to make a real one and I went with an orange robot design. It's based off of the Plakastill 
                            design era with its simple and bold colors. I thing it came out awesome and I put a lot of effort into it.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">This was a choice assignment and I chose the phone case option. We had to design 3 phone cases with a common theme and  present them in a slide show. 
                            I went with a Space/orange theme and created these 3 phone cases.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">An e-zine is a short fan based magazine. We had to create one off of a theme and the idea is to learn in design and how to make pdf's. I chose 
                            an apple theme and I went with unreleased products and how cool they are.</p>

                    <p style="padding-left: 10px;">This is a quick photoshoped picture I threw together when I carved a pumpkin and put it on my head, I chose to photshop it and make it more realistic
                        with red eyes, a dark overlay, and a scarry background (Yes, I'm waring a real pumpkin).</p>

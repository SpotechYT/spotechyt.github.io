                            but not much, and this class really helped me solidify my knowledge. This website is a collection of projects I made in class, and what I can show as a result of my skills.

                            to create pong as your first game in a new programing language. For this project, we learned how to use graphics with processing IDE
                            and basic math like score and collisions. We use stuff like fore loops, while loops, and if statements to create our game.</p>

                            and learn to use images and sounds and create assets for our game. We could have made anything we wanted with a base of mouse controls and 
                            keyboard controls, but I chose to create the original game with my own twist of assets and sounds. I created all the sound effects with my 
                            mouse and a mic and I created all the graphics at pixelart.com</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">The IEEE code of Ethics is a list of rules that social media platforms should follow regarding the privacy and treatment of their users. Facebook, one of the most popular social media platforms of all time, broke these rules may times and may ways when they did not tolerate disrespectful posts, they had a algorithm that promoted most liked posts despite weather or not they were accurate, and they sold the information of users to 3rd parties without their consent for advertising purposes and revenue.
                        Facebook did not tolerate disrespectful posts. They practiced giving everyone freedom of speech and did not care about tolerating and setting rules for the posts made on the platform. For instance, a certain race might post a hate comment about another race, and anyone that's part of the race that initial posted it would give it a like therefore making that post more popular and more people would see it leading to online fights between races and groups. In response, Facebook created a list of guidelines that posts must follow with strict consequences such as permanently being banned and suspended from Facebook.
                        Facebook also had a bias algorithm that promoted posts with more reactions despite the information contained within them. This lead to misinformation being suggested and spread to all users and causing a huge problem on the platform. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg talked about it publicly and tried his best to fix it, but until today, some posts sneak past and are not caught by the algorithm.
                        Facebook also sold the personal information of their users and invaded their privacy. Facebook would collect the data of users over the age of 15 including their liked posts, their friend and family, and their personal posts and stories to sell them to third party advertisement companies to use for advertisement purposes and all of this without their user's consent. In return, the user gets personalized ads to improve revenue of all the companies involved with this deal.
                        In conclusion, Facebook has broken a lot of IEEE rules and are trying their best to fix them. I think that we should be explicitly asked about every aspect of out data instead of Facebook just throwing a long terms of policies during account registration. We should have our freedom to keep our so-called private information private and choose who to share it with. This will prevent lots of problems in the future and help the internet to grow to a safe and reliable place.

                        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">I created a pumpkin in Java because we had to do it for Halloween. it introduced us to graphics with JFrame, 
                            the REAL java graphics library. I chose to make a pumpkin looking apple with a sans face on top. we had to draw the coordinates on paper then plot them 
                            POINT BY POINT in java. It took a while, but I am proud of what I used my time doing.</p>

                        So, like every programmer, I made one myself. This includes themes for Vs Code, Github, Atom, Firefox, Terminal, Photoshop, a startpage, and matching wallpapers, complete with the source

                    <p style="padding-left: 10px;">I've always seen people make music on launchpads and have always wanted to try it myself, but soon realized I
                        don't have a talent for music. Instead, I saw my launchpad as a giant macropad, and used my python skills to make a few fun games like connect4 and a memorization game.
                        I also created a controler script to make programing new games easier and allow anyone to make their own games, too.
